dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X. My
patches make it slower and larger but do not interfere at all with 
its dynamism.

Patches I have added:
alpha
cfacts-vanitygaps
incrementtags
statuscmd
dwmc
swallow
warp
xrdb

- dwmc, xrdb, vanitygaps, and alpha are all aeshetic "improvements"
- swallow, cfacts, statuscmd, and warp are functional "improvements"
- increment tags is a function I have made to improve the Dualshock
  experience on dwm
